    I am 33 years old. I was a terrible student who barely passed high school. It is a tradition in my family to work as an interpreter for the deaf. However I put it off for a long time and when I eventually decided to get into interpreting I became really scared because I quickly learned that you can't interpret something you don't know. So if I was interpreting algebra to a deaf student who would otherwise succeed, I would fail them and possibly cause them to fail as well. I couldn't live with that.

    So while I was in school studying to become an interpreter, I was simultaneously studying math on Khan Academy. Because of this site I was able to score a higher placement in college. Right now I have a very bright student I'm working with who is deaf. I am confidently able to interpret what's being taught and I know I am not skewing the message. I COULD NOT have done this without this site. So now whatever students I work with don't have to work twice as hard to make up for my mistakes as an interpreter.

    Not only that, so many of the videos are captioned! This means the deaf students can learn the same way I did! I have also tried to talk to some of the staff in one of my schools to allow non-deaf students to earn community service hours by captioning the videos that have yet to be captioned. Hopefully this project will be successful!
