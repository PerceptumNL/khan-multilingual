    Math to me is the fundamental tool in anyones tool box.  My tool box was not looking so hot until Khan Academy came about.  I have always had a desire to learn mathematics and become proficient, but it was a challenge to me in the traditional classroom setting.  In the last 27 days I have relearned many of the mechanics of mathematics due to your innovative teaching tool that your team provided .  Mr. Khan, you and your team are revolutionizing the way a top level education can be provided.  A top level education for free seems to me to be stealing, expect a donation in the mail.  Thank You
