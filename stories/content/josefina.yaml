    I am a 20-year old student, working really really hard to get accepted to med-school here in Finland. In order to get accepted, you have to pass an entrance-exam which basically consists of a whole lot of high-school physics, maths, and chemistry, and of course som biology. My whole life I've suffered from some kind of learning-disability when it comes to math, so doing equations and calculate things in physics and chemistry, has always been such a struggle for me, and has been my whole entire life. But then i stumbled upon this site, and I could sit in private and view the math-videos over and over again until I learned, and it has really helped me. My dream is to pass the exam this spring and become a doctor, a pediatrician to be specific. Than you Sal, for giving me this amazing opportunity.
