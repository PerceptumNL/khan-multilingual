    Despite being in one of the best public high schools in the country, I continue to have sub-par teachers who only cater to a student who memorizes and spits the information back at them. I am not one of those students. I need to be able to understand conceptually what is going on to be able to remember and perform calculations. Mr. Khan has helped me be able to do that and keep my grades up in my honors math and chemistry classes. I appreciate this website more than you can imagine and my classmates and I would all be failing if it weren't for your videos. I wish all teachers would use these videos and spend more class time helping us instead of lecturing. Perhaps someday. Until then, I will continue to watch your videos and be thankful that they are at my disposal.
