    Hi, Khan and friends!

    My name is Rayana, I'm brazilian girl and have 24 years-old.

    Since I was born, I always studied in public schools here in my country and, unfortunately, they are in poor conditions since a long time. Education here seems not be a priority. Many times, I didn't have teachers of maths or sciences and this caused a gap in my education. When I finished high school, I had to pay a course to learn more, so this way I could make the tests for entrance on college (on Brazil, this tests is called "vestibular").

    After two year, I was able to enter on a college to study architecture. I had to move to another city (a big one) and I suffered a lot there, because I didn't fit in the course. It was a very difficult time, because I saw my dreams falling apart, the college of architecture was not what I was looking for and give up seemed so wrong. After a couple of years, I decided to drop college and try another course. My parents became very worried about me, because that time I already had 23 years-old and enter on another college would be very hard.

    My desire was to learn maths and go to a engineering school, but my feeling it was that I was too old for that. Like I said, I didn't have many teachers in that area and the ones that I had were in the most unprepared. I thought that this was a impossible dream, that I couldn't achieve.

    In the beginning of last year, I found the Khan Academy and decided to see some videos. I always studied english all by myself, so I had no problems on watching videos in english language. I started at arithmetics and moved on. I learned things that I didn't know that I could learn. It was like my brain were expanding and things became more clear to me. That really changed my life and all the perspective I had about my future.

    In 2012, I'm going to studing Material Engineering at a college here. I can't believe how fast things are changing in my life, and thanks to Salman Khan I can make a new future for me. Just wanna to say thanks and ask you something: never give up of your beautiful work and from us, students. Sorry about my bad english, like I said, learned by myself.
