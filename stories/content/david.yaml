    I took a few years off after college and KA was a great resource to relearn the things I forgot since high school. I understand that the badges and energy points are more geared towards getting kids excited about learning but they work for me too (I'm almost 22). I know they aren't worth anything but it's nice to have my progress tracked and to feel like I'm earning something along the way.
