    As a mother of two, I never thought I would need to finish my college education while my babies were young.  My family is so important to me.  But when my husband left us few years ago, I realized that in order to provide for my family I had to finish somehow.  I hadn't taken biology, chemistry, or math for a number of years and had forgotten much of what I had learned before.  I also never dreamt that I could get A's in those classes.  Its not much to many people, but I am getting a general studies associates degree next month and I am applying to nursing school.  I feel good about my application for nursing because I have gotten A's in all my science courses thanks to your videos!  You have saved me in chemistry!  That class was so hard for me and I am on my way to having A's this semester too in my Microbiology and Anatomy and Physiology class.  The majority of my understanding of the more complicated processes has come from Khan Academy.  THANK YOU!!!!  I know I could never have done this without your wonderful organization.  Thank you!  I am on my way to taking care of my children, and I know you will help them as well on their journey to excellent education.
