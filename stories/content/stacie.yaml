    ...I am 40 years old, returning to school for nursing. My ENTIRE life I have hated fractions and percentages - especially in the format of a word problem! It felt like my brain did a wibble-wobble and then froze up after reading them. Strangely, algebra I'm great at - no problem!!  Now I finally...FINALLY understand fractions & percentages and how to put the word problem into an algebraic equation I can understand and SOLVE!! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
