    My youngest daughter struggles in math and it was a Godsend with her.  Her twin brother is gifted in math, but has OCD, and it was a Godsend with him in a whole different way.  My middle daughter is fiercely independent, and it was a place she could go when she didn't want to ask for help.

    My daughter first introduced me to your website after using it in her college classes where she is studying to be a teacher.  As a former high school math teacher, I was immediately thrilled at the idea of a place students could go to learn at THEIR pace, without fear that someone is going to laugh at them for asking the same question over and over, and where they can skip ahead if they understand something and don't need to spend time on something they already understand.

    I currently work as a teacher in a children's hospital, and I truly cannot put into words how your site has helped our patients.  Kids dealing with horrible illnesses will watch a video when they would never consider opening a textbook.  When they have "chemo-brain" and can't remember what they learned last week or last month, you are there for them to learn it again..and again and again if needed.  When they are stuck in the hospital and have so little control over anything at all in their own lives, they can have some control over their learning because of you.

    You have given my own kids and my hospital kids an immeasurable gift.  There are not good enough words to say thank you appropriately.  You are angels.
