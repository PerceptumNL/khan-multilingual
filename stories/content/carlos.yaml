    I'm a DCPS math teacher.  Your videos and practice exercises have been an incredible resource for my instruction and  for my student's learning.  My students are engaged when working on your practice exercises.  Your exercises on graphing equations are awesome!  Many students have already asked if they can work on your site at home.  As a teacher  it is music to my ears when student shares with me that they want to voluntarily  do math at home.  Your having an impact on our kids :)
