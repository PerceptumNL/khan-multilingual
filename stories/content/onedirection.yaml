    I have always been blessed with getting to study at private international schools all around the world! When I was a little kid, I liked Addition and Multiplication but Subtraction, and Division and everything after that made no sense! I hated math and detested it soo much! I should've actually failed my math classes but somehow, most likely due to the projects, passed the class barely!!! When I reached Pre-Algebra...I got so confused with even one-step equations! That was how much I sucked at Math. Then I reached Algebra and my parents told me about Khan Academy. I went on but doubting how Sal could even possibly help me! However I was sadly mistaken. Sal helped me soo much to understand that in the summer I go on Khan Academy and just practice! I finished Algebra with an A!!!!!! I don't think I have ever gotten an A in Math!!! I even helped my classmates with math!!! I didn't think that was possible before! Today I am doing Geometry and it is hard, but even if i get confused, I just come back to Khan Academy and Sal helps me to understand everything. Sometimes, no everyday, I think that Sal helps me understand math more than my own Geometry teacher!!!!! I think I am starting to actually like math (so unbelievable, and yes I said it!) and it's all because of SAL!!!! Khan Academy is amazing!!! NEVER STOP IT!!!!
