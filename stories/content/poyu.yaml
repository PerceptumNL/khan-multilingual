    ...I heard about Khan Academy somewhere on the net so I checked it out, and it totally blew my mind (just like how d/dx(ln x)=1/x). I couldn't believe there is someone out there actually making videos teaching wonderful things!

    Education in Taiwan is a huge mess. It seems like we study just for exams and diplomats. Thankfully I know some English so I can go online and see all the resources out there that I really want to learn . But I still have to pass my college class, which I don't really have interest in (especially calculus). I heard about Khan Academy somewhere on the net so I checked it out, and it totally blew my mind (just like how d/dx(ln x)=1/x). I couldn't believe there is someone out there actually making videos teaching wonderful things! The way you teach calculus is much much more interesting than how my school teacher teaches it! And it's way better than reading textbooks all by myself. This is the place where I truthfully learned calculus (the principles and uses of it). I used to hate it, but now I love it! I wish there is more and more videos in the future on different topics, such as Electrical Engineering and Computer Science because I'm a double E student. I would love to see you teach those topics!
    
    Anyway, thanks for everything, without Khan Academy, I would give up on calculus. If ever I have the chance, I want to thank Mr. Khan in person, he inspired me a lot.
