    Khan Academy has given me the ability to do more in math, than I ever thought I was going to be able to extract and grasp out of my text books. I started watching mid semester and saw an instant improvement in:
    • Knowledge. I began to grasp the purpose and point in what I was doing and being able to carry the knowledge through the proceeding chapters. Being able to go back to the basics, have everything explained thoroughly, and being able to pause, or rewind the extensive collection of instructional videos (if needed) has been such an extreme help!
    • Confidence. I was thrown into special education program in school at a young age, though, I still don’t know why. In this program I was not taught, I was merely pushed through the class with a passing grade regardless of the amount of positive or negative effort on my part. Now I am in college courses and started in pre-algebra level math. I was literally petrified of the amount of math ahead of me. Seeing the decline in my math grades going from pre-algebra to introductory algebra I was literally about to lose all hope, literally bawling, scared. Given this background I felt I had a lot against me but I want to graduate, and now I really feel I can!
    • Grades. I had in immediate incline in my math grade. The proof in in my chapter test percentages. I was truly looking at failing and now I’m getting the material and *gasp* enjoying studying!
    Thank you, for all that you do!
