    I always felt that a solid foundation for higher education was something I  couldn't afford - that I would have to scrape by with figuring things out for myself or making the most out of the poor conditions I could afford.  KhanAcademy has made subjects like Calculus and Chemistry accessible to me.  Despite what I am financially limited to, I have a means to reach beyond what I am given in class and explore larger concepts. I'm typically a C- math student. Now I'm getting A's and B's.  Furthermore, Khan Academy offers clear explanations of very complex social  issues and current events - -a tutorial on SOPA and PIPA!? Brilliant!  Access and understanding to such information is something the US needs very badly.
