    I dropped out of High School in the 10th Grade. I was a very good student back then. Infact, I hated school. However, I did end up getting my GED and taking a few courses in college, mainly English and Reading classes. Now I am 31, married with a little girl, and one on the way. My education has now become important to me. I enrolled in college and transferred my credits. However, they said I had no College Math classes so I needed to take a PERT for Math. Well, I knew I needed to study. I had heard about Khan through someone at work. I spent a few months learning, watching videos and taking practice questions. Today, I finally took my PERT. I needed a score of 123 to place in College Level math. Well I got a score of 135! I couldnt have done it without this service. My family and I are truly grateful. I already signed up for College Algebra. We'll see how that goes. Thank you!
