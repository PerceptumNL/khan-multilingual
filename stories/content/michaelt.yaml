    I've been in classes to get my G.E.D. I'm 42yrs.old. Before I heard about Khan Academy I took a pre test and scored 64% on it. After hearing about your site I have been using it in class and at home. I retook the test on 4/5/12 and scored 96% on it. This is the results from using your site for a month or less. I really appreciate all your hard work and dedication to helping students and adults who are in school. Thank You.
