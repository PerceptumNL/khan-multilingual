    This was sent to me by a friend in Washington.  I suggested her 10-year-old son, Hunter, is suffering from a bad case of undiagnosed giftedness and should be set loose on Khan Academy - 
    
    You will be thrilled to know that Khan Academy is now being used in all 3 fourth grade classrooms (and I believe the 5th grade classrooms) at my son's school.  After I showed Damon all about Khan, we talked about incorporating it into Hunters weekly routine.  Then, next time Damon volunteered at school, he mentioned it to Hunter's teacher in the teachers lounge during lunch a few weeks ago and none of the teachers had even heard of it.  But the next week, Hunter's teacher included it on a daily extra star activity.  Then last week, the spring break extra credit was doing 30 minutes of Khan Academy for 5 days out of spring break.  I think that the teachers were really happy to find an online program that was a lot more useful, more intuitive, and also let the kids work at their own pace, rather than have to slog thru already learned practices to get to the math exercises they are currently learning.  It's nice also because teachers can highlight the specific math problems they are learning that week and the kids can go online and walk thru it step by step without the normal classroom distractions.  It's helped Hunter quite a bit and he has been placed in the "sorta advanced" math group with the 5th grade math teacher.  I've always known that Hunter is pretty smart and catches on pretty quickly, but his learning skills tend to get in the way in the classroom because he isn't able to focus as easily as others when there are distractions around.  Eventually I'm hoping he'll become interested in computer science or programming, create his first app in 7th grade, sell it for a cool 1 mill after it's been downloaded by over 75% of smartphone users, and then be set for college and have some left over for capital in his next startup...  A mom's gotta dream, right?  Thanks to you for telling me about Khan, and starting a little chain of events that I hope helps the learning process for teachers, parents and most of all the students!
