    Last year, I was a home-schooled eighth-grader struggling in math, and in my studies in general. The online system my mother was using for me and my three siblings at the time was not only a monthly drain on expenses for her, but it couldn't seem to teach me anything, and when I did learn I did so reluctantly.
    I would begin attending a 'real' school the next semester, and I was terrified, sure I'd fail everything, particularly math.
    However, after seeing an article about the website in a magazine, I began working on Khan Academy at the end of the school year, and then through the summer, all voluntarily, without my mother's usual prompting.
    Last fall, I began attending a Catholic school. The transition was difficult for me, but made easy by the fact that over one summer I'd shot up from struggling to ahead of the game.
    I've settled into school now, and still use Khan Academy on a daily basis for help with homework or just for fun. The badges and patches attract my three grade-school siblings at well, who are also excelling in math.
    Thank you, Khan, for helping me sustain an almost straight-A report card! You're all amazing and a real blessing! :)
