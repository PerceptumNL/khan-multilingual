    I've wanted to work in IT since I was 11 years old.  When my first attempt at college didn't go so well, I figured I'd join the Air Force and get started in IT that way.  As an added bonus, I'd get some great educational benefits that would allow me to return to college when I was more mature.  Everything went well and I spent my six years in the Air Force doing IT work and then followed it up with four more years as a contractor for the Air National Guard.  I quickly discovered that IT was not the career for me but the pay was good and it was the only job I had ever considered doing.  Even with all of that money, it was making me miserable, but I had no other ideas.

    Then I started reading astronomy books for fun.  The warm feeling I got in my chest every time I read a book about astronomy was incomparable to any other feeling I have ever had.  I looked up the course requirements at all of the nearby universities and all of their four year plans began with calculus.  I was more at the low end of algebra and I wasn't even very good at that.  I decided astronomy was out of the question.  I only had four years of GI Bill benefits and I wasn't even good at math.  I tried to find another science that didn't require as much math, but nothing brought out that warm feeling that I got when I read my astronomy books.

    Then it occurred to me.  I had at least five months before Fall semester started at any school in the area.  My job was reactionary and I spent the majority of my work time waiting for something to break.  Instead of spending 8 hours a day playing games on my iPad at work, I could spend 8 hours a day learning math.  There had to be resources all over the internet to teach math, right?  There were and I played with some of them for a couple days and made a little bit of progress.  Then I discovered Khan Academy.  At first, I only used it for its exercises, but as the math got more advanced, I started watching the videos too.  I was hooked.  Turns out I'm actually great at math!  I just needed a good teacher.  I spent 8 hours a day at work on Khan Academy, then I'd go home and do some more.  I'd even spend some of my weekends on the website.  I started off at the base of the exercise tree with simple arithmetic and two and a half weeks later I had finished what would have been Calculus I in a traditional classroom.

    I immediately applied to school and tested into precalculus, which was the highest that I could go via placement test, quit my job, and in Fall 2011 I became a physics major at Crafton Hills College.  I'll be transferring to University of California Riverside in Fall 2013 to finish my BS in physics, after which I intend to begin my PhD in astrophysics.

    Without Khan Academy, I never would have had the confidence to go into a field that involved so much math.  I never would have placed high enough to graduate within my window of benefits, which was the only way I was going to quit my job.  I never would have even known that I love math and that I'm very good at it!

    I just finished my first semester and I love being in school.  I run a study group for my math class where I use a lot of the procedures and explanations that I learned from Sal to help my classmates succeed.  Next semester, I hope to become a math tutor for the school.  I can't thank Khan Academy enough for helping me reshape my life and I'm sure I will continue to use it to supplement my in-class education until the day I graduate.
