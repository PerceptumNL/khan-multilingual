    ...I decided to take linear algebra this term, and for the first two tutorials I felt completely lost. I was afraid to ask my tutor questions because he would just look at me like I'm stupid. I must have scored a 30% on the problems sheets, at best. I started panicking that I wasn't going to be able to pass the course, get a masters in econ, get the career I want, etc, etc

    I'm a junior in college studying abroad at Oxford, which has been a wonderful opportunity, but the one-on-one tutorial system can be a little intimidating! I decided to take linear algebra this term, and for the first two tutorials I felt completely lost. I was afraid to ask my tutor questions because he would just look at me like I'm stupid. I must have scored a 30% on the problems sheets, at best. I started panicking that I wasn't going to be able to pass the course, get a masters in econ, get the career I want, etc, etc. So last week, I watched your videos on linear independence and basis, and astoundingly, it all came through! I didn't get a single problem wrong on the homework! I'm actually excited to go to my next tutorial and spew out that knowledge. Your work is truly amazing. I was telling my story to a friend who's volunteering at a school in Ghana over the summer. Guess how the school is offering an education to children for minimal cost? They're using Khan Academy. Thank you so, so, so much Khan. You deserve the Nobel prize!!!
