    I am a home schooled ten-year-old girl who used to hate math. This largely started with the strain of Saxon Math which had timed tests which really stressed me out, I have always been a person who gets upset if something is not perfect. When I moved to doing Teaching Textbooks at age 9, I started sixth grade math. I must say, it was hard, but I was very glad that I was not doing the 4th grade math which my seven year old brother was doing. Soon, Math became a tiresome chore, to put it simply, a complete bother. It was only about four months ago that my Dad showed me this, and started me out on a Geometry video. Then I became crazed about Khan Academy. Thanks to the videos, I was able to skip Pre-Algebra and move straight to Algebra. Now on your website I am able to work at my own speed, doing Geometry, Algebra and Statistics. My many thanks to you sir, I do not think I could find a better pastime. THANK YOU.
