    I teach 3rd grade in a rural, low-income area near Knoxville, TN.  Most of my students do not have access to computers or internet at home.  Mostly, my learners began the year with a distaste for math and an associated low self-esteem in the subject.  My school is unique with our mission closely aligned with innovating instruction using technology.  We have a computer lab, 4 student computers in my room, and I was lucky to pilot our district's 1:1 iPod Touch program.
    
    I began the year rotating students through my 4 classroom computers during daily math centers.  YouTube was blocked at the time, so I'd begin a unit by downloading a video at home and showing to the whole group the following day.  With soaring support from our district tech supervisor, Google and YouTube access was opened on the server.  Then, the Archiver App was released for iPhone/iPod and I was able to assign videos for students to view on their iPods for homework.  Once per week my class has the computer lab reserved for math where every learner can work on modules at their own pace.
    
    Now, there are 3 weeks left in the school year.  My kids beg me to log onto Khan Academy because it's fun and they want to keep earning those energy points!  My class began the year, on average, slightly below grade level.  Year-end data indicates average growth of 3+ grade levels in math!  My kids love math now and are hungry for more math content.  They are eager to advance and are accountable for their own learning.  KA has given me the flexibility to challenge advanced students with projects and devote quality 1:1 time with others struggling on a topic.  Peer-support has also grown dynamically with Khan academy.  It's amazing to see children coming to the aid of their classmate and creatively reteaching a topic they have already mastered.  I am a firm believer in Khan Academy's philosophy and encourage all teachers to consider using this learning tool in some fashion that suits your classroom's needs.
