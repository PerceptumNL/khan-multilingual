    Hope.  That is what I felt when I discovered this wonderful resource.  I am a 39 year old hairstylist re-enrolling in college classes with a renewed interest in math and science.  I believed, unitl finding your website, that smart people were born that way. I remember the frustration of sitting in my stuffy high school math class not wanting to raise my hand- again- embarassed that I was not on the same page as my peers not wanting to see my teacher's look of exasperation because I was the only one that didn't "get it".  As I get older I realize through hard work and dedication and practice, practice, practice we are ALL capable of the unthinkable!  I aspire to be a Chemical Engineer and believe this is very tangible thanks to your amazing contribution.  I speak to hundreds of people  and am able to share the hope that you have brought me.  No longer do we have to pay excessive tuition fees for boring lectures and antiquated teaching practices that have nothing to do with actual life applications.  You have changed what I view as possible.  You have changed my life!  Thank you!
