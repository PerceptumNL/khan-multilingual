    ...I was very anxious, but after watching your tutorials all day, I could hear your voice in my head saying "okay, this is how I like to do this", and "we need to get rid of some of this stuff..." to help me think of what to do with complex equations - I am so thrilled, saved me a lot of money as well as my summer Saturdays re-doing algebra!

    Thanks Sal - you are the best, I passed my algebra placement test on my second try, it's been years since I had algebra and you made all the difference!   I was very anxious, but after watching your tutorials all day, I could hear your voice in my head saying "okay, this is how I like to do this", and "we need to get rid of some of this stuff..." to help me think of what to do with complex equations - I am so thrilled, saved me a lot of money as well as my summer Saturdays re-doing algebra!   You are the man Sal - math teachers have now become totally awesome in my book ~ you saved the day for me!
