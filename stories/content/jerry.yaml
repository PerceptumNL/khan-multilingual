    I'm 69 years old, a writer and photographer. I decided I wished I'd studied calculus, so I went to Khan Academy. I quickly discovered that I needed to brush up on my algebra, and before that, on my pre-algebra. I'm nearly through algebra now, three months later, and this morning topped 100,000 points. I've never had to much fun learning anything.
