    As a previous university dropout returning to university to study electrical engineering nearly 9 years later, Khan Academy has truly been instrumental in my success. I was never an amazing student in high school, mostly due to lack of interest, and pretty much did the bare minimum to get into university. Carrying forward that attitude into first year computer science got me excluded on academic grounds by the end of that year. At that time I had not realized the opportunity I had, having gotten into the top university in Africa (University of Cape Town). 8 years later I had matured and grown enough to realize what I wanted to do with my life, ironically it was similar to what I had done originally, only even more difficult, both the degree itself and to get accepted (especially after being excluded). I applied for electrical and computer engineering at UCT for 2011, but promptly got my application rejected. My dad encouraged me (I am thankful for supportive parents without them where I am now would not be possible) to apply to another university, which I was luckily accepted by despite my previously terrible academic record. My intention from the get go was to get top marks in order to reapply to UCT. Now as a rusty 27 year old student who had not done any maths or physics in the past 8 years, I had some serious catching up to do. I stumbled on Khan Academy half way through the first semester after realizing that the old "parrot" style taught in school was not going to cut in anymore. This time round I wanted to develop an intuitive grasp of everything, it wasn't good enough just to know a formula , I had to know where it came from, what it's source was , and I had to be able to know how to derive it from scratch. More importantly all the ideas had to make intuitive sense to me, I had to able to see them visually. Sal's approach to learning was exactly what I was looking for , and I promptly watched nearly all the videos on first year calculus in addition to many of the videos on simple things I had forgotten. (I had even forgotten how to add fractions initially :)). The end result that semester ? 92% in maths, along with 4 other subjects above 80%. (5 A's and 1 B). I wrote my second semester maths exam with virtually no practice, just pure understanding of the concepts , and again managed 90%. The net result was 9 A's for the year and 2 B's. To cut a long story short, I reapplied to UCT, and was accepted for 2012. I later learned that out of 1000 candidates only 180 were chosen and I was one! I consider myself extremely lucky to get back in , and I have Khan Academy to thank for allowing me develop that deep understanding. Learing is now a pleasure, and I am confident I will repeat my academic sucess this year.
    
    Experiencing this fresh perspective on learing , I realized how outdated the current model of learning is even at university level. I find myself gravitating towards resources like Khan Academy rather than attending lectures. I also feel that the testing system does not encourage mastery you mentioned in a TED talk, how can you ride a unicycle if you haven't even mastered a bike?. This has made me realize what I want to do with the knowledge I obtain from this degree, to put it your words Sal , "To increase the net positivity in the world". I want to use the knowledge and skill to further the spread of free education. So once again I have Khan Academy to thank for helping me realize that. I want others to be able to have the same benefits I do with access to all these incredible resources. We can all be life long learners then. I is also important to make education more fun and more intuitive, both children and adults alike are naturally curious about the world around them, but it is vital to make learing resources both fun and informative at the same time. The natural curosity to learn should be the primary motivational factor. Khan Academy is the embodiment of these principles and I am truly thankful for everything you have done, not just for me but for the world.
