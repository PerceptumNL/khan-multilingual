    The day before my physics final, one of my oldest friends committed suicide. I couldn't focus, couldn't think...Everything I learned vanished.  I'm not sure who did your currents/resistors/etc tutorials but...Thank you.  
    
    I had to relearn everything, and the way you put things made sense. Not to mention, and I don't mean to sound odd, but your voice was really comforting. I did very well on my final, and it got me through a rough night. I know it might not be your goal, helping people on that level...But seriously, thank you.
