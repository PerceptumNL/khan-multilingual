    To whom it may concern,

    I am a classic case of a smart a** ADD kid whose grades plummeted after getting a math teacher who couldn't teach or reproduce answers to the problems in our own text books. I had been bumped to the 2nd highest math class through year 9-10. By grade 11 anything other than the working in our text books was an instant fail. I read these questions like a learner drivers test, as if they were worded to deliberately confuse, and it just confused people to try reproduce as the book was teaching. Eventually I was moved to the back of the class and was ignored, every time I spoke or tried to help I was told to shut up in sign language, because and I quote the teacher had "had enough of me". At this point all my grades fell, I lost interest and had a massive "You ruined your life" fight with my parents. 10 years down the track I have avoided going back to school for the reason that failure costs money that I or my parents cannot and don't want to afford. I realize that in quite a few things it has taken me a little longer to learn something, but I recognize the eureka moment which happens each time. It took me weeks and months to learn how to ride and skate, but now I would consider myself better than my peers.

    In short this is a thank you for your services. As a gamer I am used to the idea of grinding through problems and trying to show as little response to failure and just repeating things over and over again.  Your maths game has given me something to look forward to each morning, and I hope to see the Khan institute branch out and dominate the current shoddy education systems all over the world.

    Again thank you and keep up the good work.
