    I have ALWAYS loved math.  I got an A on my final exam at school.  I love "Playing" your math module.  I have been out of school for over 30 years now and I would rather do your math questions than do crossword puzzles.  I realized how much I have forgotten since my school days and your videos are absolutely EXCELLENT.  You have such a soothing voice and your explanations are so easy to follow.  Thank you so much for the Khan Academy.  I don't have too much money, but if I did I promise you I would donate a HUGE amount to your academy.  We have grandchildren living with us and they will also be able to use your site when they are old enough.  Also, if they don't get it I will be able to help them.  Thank you so much, again.
