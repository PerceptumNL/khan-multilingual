    Dear Sal,

    I am 19 years old, and come from a small town in Pennsylvania.  I did very well in school until I was exposed to Algebra in 8th grade.  My grades began to drop and I felt very discouraged.  My parents, teachers, and peers were all unable to get through to me.  I was in a similar situation to your cousin Nadia.  Ever since I was a child, I knew that math and science interested me, but the school system sort of beat the curiosity out of me.  I became apathetic toward education and viewed going to school as a chore.  

    In 10th grade I started to take classes online out of laziness and disinterest.  This persisted until 11th grade, when I first saw your videos.  I had been struggling with the unit circle, essentially trying to learn it out of the textbook.  I watched your videos and it all clicked.  Not only did you help me understand concepts in trigonometry, but you made me realize that anyone can learn the material when it is presented in the right way.  You inspired me greatly.  I knew what I had to do for my senior year.  During the summer, I watched a few of your videos a day and filled in the gaps so I would be prepared for Calculus.  I returned to public school and took the initiative to speak with the teachers and guidance counselor to take AP Calculus, AP Computer Science, and AP Economics, even though I met the prerequisites for none of them.  I applied myself, and did great in all of them.  I got 100% on the in-class final exam in Calculus, and had the highest grade in the class.  It was my first year ever programming, and I finished the Comp Sci class with a 98%.  By taking these classes and being exposed to the material in the right way, I realized how much I loved math and science.

    Your videos have helped me in many ways.  Not only were you able to help me understand mathematical concepts, but in listening to your interviews, you have inspired me to learn more -- about everything!  I once hated history, in retrospect, mainly because of the way it is taught in class.  Biology was nothing more than memorizing facts (without a hint of evolution), and Math was learning how to solve for x the way the book told you to.  Your videos have given me a new outlook on life and allowed me to see the big picture.  I can't tell you how much it means to me that you are offering this service for free.  I come from a low income family, so hiring a tutor or paying for expensive software was not an option for me.  I'm so glad that you're doing this, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.  I always thought it was absurd to put a price tag on knowledge, perhaps the most important thing for the future of our species.  Nothing could be more important than educating the world.  I think your videos have helped the world in more ways than you can imagine.  I have given my friends the same inspiration and helped them with the same math problems that you helped me with.  Education is exponential!

    It is largely because of your work, not just in teaching me the concepts, but giving me insight into why I should learn the concepts in the first place, that I will be going to college later this year to study math and computer science.  I can definitely say that it's because of you, and people that express your enthusiasm about learning, that I changed tracks in life, and am now on a path to pursuing further education.  I hope that one day I can make as big of a positive impact on the world as you have!  Thank you so much.
