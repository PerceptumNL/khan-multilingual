    I first started using the Khan Academy when I was teaching third grade at Yokohama International School in Japan.  I was finding that the third grade text was not sufficiently rigorous for some of my students so I set them up with Khan accounts and let them go.  This was mostly unstructured and those with a real interest, really took it and ran with it on their own.  Almost creating their own parallel math curriculum.  I was just a beginner!
    
    I then moved to Boise and to Riverstone to teach fourth grade.  Once again, I set my kids up with accounts and again, let them "have at it".  They mostly just started at the top and followed the "suggested activities" route.  Although as we progressed through the year, I started to specifically direct students towards particular exercises/videos.
    
    Over the summer, I did more research and decided that there had to be a better way to use it.  This time, when the year started I made sure we all had accounts and I really put the coaching tools to work for me.  I was more explicit in asking kids to watch specific videos or try particular exercises.  I was guided by our math curriculum and instead of the lecture/practice format that each lesson in the book began with, I would assign videos/links as homework with the instruction that the kids would need to know those particular concepts in order to participate fully in class the next day.   In class, instead of working from the front of the lesson and hoping there was time for the enrichment and problem solving at the end, I started with those types of problems.  The homework pages were also more application of concepts so we did those in class too rather than at home.  Phrases like "Math is awesome" started to echo around the room.
    
    My teaching partner = the other fifth grade teacher - started using it too.  The kids loved the points and the "rivalry" was on.  When our classes were about to hit 2 million points, there was a huge competition to be the first - when else would you hear whooping and the sound of furious problem solving at 2:30pm on a Friday?
    
    KA has been a great tool for raising the bar in my classroom.  I love the clarity and simplicity of the videos.  I love the addition of Vi Hart to the team - we just watched her nature and numbers series and I now have a class of math doodlers who talk about "that awesome video" they watched last night.  The tools also help me get a read on where the kids are at.  Interestingly, the majority of the kids watch the video as a backup - they typically start with an exercise, use the hints to see if they can figure it out and then watch the video.  Sometimes we watch the videos together in class - Sal has a way of explaining math that just can't be beat.  His exponential numbers video is an example.  It was the first time in my life that someone has explained to me why a number to the first power is always one.  I was told in school "because it is".  Now I understand why.
    
    I never liked math as a kid.  As a teacher, I love it.  I love the mystery of it, the methods and the madness!  I am really grateful to Sal and his Academy for helping me develop a greater love for math.  I love that my kids get the chance to challenge themselves and review their work on a regular basis.  I love that the videos really explain the concepts in a clear way.  I love that I have more time for doing and less need for telling.  I love that I can see my kids whiz off into the math matrix with a huge interest and passion for developing their math skills.  It is cool to love math in my classroom and I have had kids log on each week, on average, for about 2 and half to 3 hours between Monday and Thursday nights.  The "requirement" is 15 minutes a night.  I still want to do more with it - to tap into the application of the math skills in my own classroom.  I would love to go to Sal's Summer Camp as a volunteer/participant/observer and get more ideas about how to really engage kids in math after leading them to the tools to equip them to solve big and important problems.  That is inspiring.
