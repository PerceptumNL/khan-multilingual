    Hello, Today I am 54 years old.  Back when I was about 13 or so, my guidance counselor called me in to find out "what I wanted to be when I grew up."  I told her I wanted to be a scientist.  She told me that was not an acceptable goal for a girl.  She gave me 3 choices:  I could be a nurse, a teacher, or a flight attendant.  I was told to come back the next week and give her my answer.  I chose flight attendant because I thought traveling would be fun.  From that point on, I no longer thought I was capable of being a scientist and lost all interest and ability in mathematics and science.  Although I never became a flight attendant, I never became a scientist either.  I have always felt frustrated by the limitations that I internalized as a result of that experience.  So, through your website I am starting to conquer my perceived shortcomings and hopefully reconnect with the scientist within me.  I don't necessarily have any career aspirations but it is something I want to prove to myself personally.  I think your website is a fantastic tool for students of all ages and abilities.  Thank you.
