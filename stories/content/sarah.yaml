    Good morning! My name is Sarah, and I’m a high school math teacher in Iowa that is working with Des Moines Public Schools’ dropout prevention program at Hoover High School. We have started using Khan as a method for kids to earn or recover credit/s. Our kids are LOVING it. We see kids moving through the math “constellation” with great vigor! We thank you greatly for your product! We are also wild about the new Progress Summary screen that you added in the coaching tab!

    Again, thanks for all you offered to our kids!
