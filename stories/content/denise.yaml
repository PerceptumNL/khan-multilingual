    I noticed my high school age son staring at his Chemistry homework but not writing anything down. I walked over and said, "Khan Academy" (we had seen your segment on 60 Minutes and I haven't been able to stop talking about it). Since teenagers know everything (especially my son) I didn't think he'd do it. He walked out of the room ten minutes later without saying a word. He came back after 15 minutes with a little smile on his face and said, "in two minutes I found exactly the stuff I was working on". What's really amazing is that he said he got "sucked in" and continued to watch the lessons even beyond where they were in his classroom. What you are doing at Khan Academy is so revolutionary. I really think it's going to be one of the most important contributions of my generation. Thank you just isn't enough, but thank you.
