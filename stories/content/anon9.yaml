    ...I feel like I’ve spent a ton of time with you but this thank you represents the first time you hear from me. I hope there is a chance you will have time to read the following piece of raving fan mail.

    I feel like I’ve spent a ton of time with you but this thank you represents the first time you hear from me. I hope there is a chance you will have time to read the following piece of raving fan mail.
    
    I graduated this past month from a large state university that graced me with the opportunity to deliver the student address during the ceremony. The faculty chose me for my high levels of involvement at the university, my pursuit four majors simultaneously, and because I thoroughly enjoyed school and learning. The few thousand people in attendance didn’t know that, two days prior to the commencement, I postponed a CLEP examination to test out of Chemistry due to lack of preparation. Failing that test meant not graduating with any majors for another six months, the soonest I could retry the test again. Adding to the pressure, my job offer required me to graduate in three of the four majors. As a curious student I averaged more than 22 hours of classes each semester but didn’t feel as though I wanted to sit through a chem lecture and lab because of the monetary cost, time, and opportunity cost of each. I thought I could teach myself.
    
    Self-studying did not work for me in chemistry as it did in my business and humanities majors. The stress and discomfort of the possible failure to graduate spawned a feeling of gut-wrenching panic. I was entering an unhealthy state of worry. In desperate attempt for help I decided to look for a few tutorials using You-Tube when I came across your videos. I enjoyed the first two lectures and saw that you had a string of 104 videos meaning I could watch them all in about 30 hours. I immediately mapped out a study plan and rescheduled my test for the day I finished reviewing. That day, May 31st 2012, is today.
    
    Sal, I want to express my gratitude for your giving spirit and love of educating. Today I completed my college career when I tested out of Chemistry (with a comfortable margin of safety ).  Your videos made that possible. It took me two weeks to get through the Chemistry lectures and even though some people may feel your goofy cheesy comments distract from the learning goal, they kept me engaged so keep the personality in there for us nerds please.
    
    Over the next year I plan to review the other video topics and reinforce fundamental concepts that never fully stuck or may have slipped away while in school. I also wish to extend my willingness to help author, script, or whatever method you use to develop a curriculum for anything in accounting, finance, economics, or marketing (my four majors). I have tutored many students in these topics and enjoy helping others lean about them as well. That is a serious offer to help by the way so let me know if you’re interested.
    
    I am in full support of your mission and wish I wasn’t a fresh graduate so I could contribute financially. To return the favor I have recommended your videos to almost everyone I have talked to in the last two weeks and will continue to do so in the future. At the Rice Commencement (watched that today after my test) you mentioned the chance we might have higher peaks and lower lows than you. Please know that your effort resulted in not only mitigating but completely avoiding what would have proved a very low low for me and for that I am unexplainably, ear to ear smilingly grateful.
    
    Thanks again, Sal, and keep up the good work!
    
    Also, I was a member of the university show choir here and always wish I knew music theory as well as some of the other performers. I am amazed at how they can utilize music because they understand the science of what notes go together. That would be an excellent topic, especially because so much public funding for the arts is being re-allocated. If you could generate as much enthusiasm for music as I now have for chemistry (or learning online in general), I think humanity would be well-served.
