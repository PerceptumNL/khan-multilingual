    I joined Khan Academy about 8 months ago. In high school I did everything I could to pass with the easiest classes I could. Math never seemed important enough or I could not see the reasons to learn it. I got out of high school with only being proficient in Geometry. Now that I am in my late twenties I have decided to work towards an engineering degree in college. When I talked to the engineering councilor he told me that math was going to be my best friend for at least 6 years of classes. I read about Khan Academy in wired and looked it up while I was at work. I was amazed and still am with all the knowledge it freely provides. I am working much slower than I had hoped I would but I have already cut off a year of math and I still have a long way to go in the courses here on the website. Thank you so much for providing this place of learning and making it so easy to understand things that I never thought I could (let alone would) comprehend. I sing the praises to everyone I know about Khan Academy and I will continue to do so. Thank you for all that you do and please continue to make a huge difference in this world.
