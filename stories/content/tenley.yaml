    This is my first year in public highschool. At the beginning of the semester I soon discovered how completely lost I was in Algebra II. I had gotten all A's in all my previous maths and succeeded in geometry and Algebra I, excelling and truly enjoying each course (to my honest surprise.) This semester was different. I started out thinking I would know everything, and I didn't. As a result my grades suffered tremendously and I got an awful new impression of public school life. I tried desperately to understand every new concept I was presented with and showed up every morning at 7:15 to procure the guidance and help of my math teacher. She helped me diligently and was willing every morning that I came, but every time I understood a new concept another one was thrown at me later in the day that I couldn't comprehend, and I ended up trapped in a pattern of consistently being mentally behind all of my peers.

    I knew about Khan and had watched a few of his videos last year just for fun every once in a while. After receiving a grade far below a C on my first test and seeing little improvement on the following quizzes and tests, I decided it was high time I visited Khan's site for a good while instead of crying my eyes out and finding whatever tutor I could get my hands on at that moment-- the day before a test. Well, I watched a video of Khan's on inequalities and graphing, the very basics. I could have cried, I couldn't believe how relieved I felt. I watched around 20 minutes of videos with thorough explanations and a casual teaching ethic, and I couldn't have been happier. Somehow every concept that just seemed so far beyond my psychological grasp came instantly, in a time far shorter than that of a class period where my teacher talks conventionally and rapidly, with no enthusiasm or interest in her voice. I can't blame her, and she means the absolute best, and I know she has all her students' interests in mind, but I have to hand it to Sal Khan for providing professional and simplistic algebraic assistance in the most intellectually stimulating and enjoyable manner, and I gaze upon my 102 grade on my most recent test with thoughts of abundant thanks to the man who saved me in math, and made me hate it just a little bit less. 

    Thank you Sal, your work is changing lives!
