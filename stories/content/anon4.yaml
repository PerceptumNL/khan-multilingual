    I home school our two daughters. One had an excellent maths experience at school - the other (now aged 10) had huge gaps in her understanding. The visual knowledge map is so incredibly helpful to her and I - she can see what the next step is and not lose sight of the big picture. I am working through the videos and exercises myself too, building up the sections on my knowledge map so that I can stay ahead of the game for my daughters. Sal is our tutor: polite, concise, friendly, and efficient in delivering knowledge. Most importantly, this work is given for free. For a family functioning on limited resources when we started our home education journey, this is invaluable. Thank you so much for your gift to humanity. I am deeply deeply grateful - you have changed our children's lives.
