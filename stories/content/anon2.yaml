    I don't know who you are but in my mind you are a savior. My children really struggle with math, there is an inherited learning disability in my family. They get it but only after seeing it done multiple times. Your videos will allow us to help our children get caught up with their peers. As a parent I have to say, Thank You Thank You Thank You.
