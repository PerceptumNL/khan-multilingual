    I had always been a strong student when it came to math. Making good grades really wasn't a challenge; however, when I entered high school I failed a couple of tests and lost all my confidence in my abilities to learn and I basically gave up. For a while I was failing, which is completely unlike me. At the start of second semester, though, I began watching your videos everyday and = brought my grade up with your help! Now I have a solid A in calculus and am at the top of my class again. When my teacher asked how I did it, I said, "It was really simple, Khan Academy videos helped me learn. I didn't memorize anything, I honestly just understand now." Thank you so much Khan Academy. You have really made learning a joy for me again!
