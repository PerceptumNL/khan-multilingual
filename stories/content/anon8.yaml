    I am generally a student who does well in school but calculus is a topic that I find hard to comprehend. I wasn't sure how to practice for the free response so I went through your example free response videos on your site. I found them to be extremely helpful. As I was reading the prompts on the actual AP Exam I found myself hearing Sal's voice in my head going through the problem exactly as he would. I also found myself underlining key words just like Sal does in his videos. I'm confident I received a 5 on my exam thanks to the help of Khan Academy. Also I am part of DECA in my high school and this past year I used Khan Academy as the business I would create an Advertising Campaign for. The judges were intrigued by the organization and my friend and I placed 7th in the state of North Carolina. I would like to thank Khan Academy for this because I feel the real reason we placed was because of our use of such an outstanding organization. I personally know an abundant amount of indivduals in my school that watch these videos and I really think what Sal is doing is amazing. I strive to serve individuals just like Sal and the Khan Academy Team someday.
