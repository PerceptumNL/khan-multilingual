    Sal and Team,

    I wanted to let you know what a huge inspiration the Khan Academy and Sal's personal commitment have been for me. August will bring my 32nd year taking high school students through the mysteries of the past. For much of my career, I have tried to make use of the power of technology to expand the opportunities for my students. In 2005, my family took a trip to Africa in which we visited schools in Uganda and Sudan. The heroic efforts of the teachers and the deep desire of students to learn was amazing. Unfortunately, the lack of resources presented an overwhelming challenge. In 2006 we returned on a crazy attempt to help one school with a small network of laptops and an internal web server with NROC and other content. We have been privileged to return several times since then but I must confess that the challenges have at times been discouraging. Sal's vision for educating the world has helped to keep us going back. This year we are very excited to be able to provide the Khan Academy videos using a copy of the World Possible Rachel Server materials. I cannot wait for the teachers and the students to see the resources. Thank you so much for the wonderful work of the Khan Academy.
