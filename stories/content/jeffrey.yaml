    Hi, I'm 41 and panicked when I found out i had to take a College Math placement exam it's been years...I was told to check out your site...I did, studied hard and went through nearly 20 tutorials and practice lessons...Yesterday the big test...I passed with a high score... I couldn't have done it without you...this thanksgiving I am thankful for Khan Academy!
