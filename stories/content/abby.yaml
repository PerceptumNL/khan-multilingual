   Ever since I was young, I struggled with math, I reached a point where I would get so stressed out over having to do any sort of math problem I would shut down and cry.  I avoided all math, and thought that it would always be this way.  Then about a year ago, I heard about the Khan Academy while watching the Colbert Report.  I thought I would check it out and see if it could help me.  I didn't have much hope especially since it was free, although I would have never spent money on learning math in the first place.  But watching the videos, being encouraged by the practice questions, boosted my confidence that I did indeed know some math.  The whole site, encouraged me to keep learning, and my self-esteem has gotten way better because of my new found confidence in my growing math skills.  Thank you Khan Academy, for making me feel like I can succeed, and that I don't have to remain in the status quo.  I'm excited to learn math, and the other topics are interesting as well, I especially love the brain teasers, though I mostly just watch them through, they remind me to view the world from different perspectives.  I am a big fan, and tell all my friends and family who need help learning anything to come to the Khan Academy!
