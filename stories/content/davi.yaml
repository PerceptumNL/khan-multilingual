    I am a third year at UCLA. Math has never been my strong subject by any means. I have one more math class to take before I can officially apply to my major. I was struggling; my professor didn't speak english very well and I never had any idea what he was talking about in class. I watched your videos and for the first time actually understood what i was doing and felt comfortable walking into my midterm. I got 100% on my midterm, was ranked #1 in the class out of 143 student, and the average score was a 59%. Thank you so much ! You are amazing !
