    ...My education foundation was poor and my home environment became worst as I grew older, even more so than I could have imagined possible. So during the first semester of my final year in high school, another Teacher Strike happened and I knew it was hopeless to continue. Instead, I found a job in hard labor, to gain the necessary funds to get me to a better place. I worked for nearly 9 months to make the equivalent of 1500 USD, which was lucky in my country's economy.  I ran away from home to the US and have been surviving ever since. However, one of my biggest dreams still had not come true. I wanted an education. Circumstances I can't go into now, prevented me from pursuing the education I wanted, but I never gave up on the dream.

    I am not ashamed to tell you that I nearly burst into tears as I found your YouTube channel and your website.  I am not sure how much I can write here or how much you would like to read about me, but I must--indeed!--I must, Thank You so much for your videos in a way that I can never explain.
    
    I was born in a Third World country to a very poor family. My parents were alcoholics and there is not much I can remember of my childhood with fondness. As a mean to escape, I immersed myself in school work, but because i could not afford to go to private schools, I was condemned to precarious, public education, which I could only get when the school teachers ended their relentless strikes and protests for better salaries.
    
    My education foundation was poor and my home environment became worst as I grew older, even more so than I could have imagined possible. So during the first semester of my final year in high school, another Teacher Strike happened and I knew it was hopeless to continue. Instead, I found a job in hard labor, to gain the necessary funds to get me to a better place. I worked for nearly 9 months to make the equivalent of 1500 USD, which was lucky in my country's economy.  I ran away from home to the US and have been surviving ever since. However, one of my biggest dreams still had not come true. I wanted an education. Circumstances I can't go into now, prevented me from pursuing the education I wanted, but I never gave up on the dream.  I taught myself as much as I could, but I can tell you that in my whole life, i can count the number of times I had a math class in one hand. I can tell you I never had a Biology or Physics class, ever.
    
    But no more. This year I am presented with the opportunity to attend schools and finally begin the realization of my real dream. But something still amiss. How can I compete in a world out there without EVER having grasp mathematics?  I searched YouTube for videos. It was very hard to sift through the pop stars and music videos, even when I searched specifically for what I was looking for, but when I did find something remotely significant, the teacher would lack excitement, or I would be confronted with a demo or an advertizement for something else. I am ashamed to tell you that at the age of 30, I find myself, again, in a situation where I cannot afford to pay too much money for classes.  
    
    Then I found you. People who actually think like me, but have the means to do what I dream to do one day: to help those who can't, but are trying really hard. I found so many options, so many different classes in your site I don't even know where to start, but now I know that I can start somewhere. I have spent hours listening to your videos and there's much more on the website and they are ALL amazingly organized and elaborated. I can understand the explanation and instead of feeling overwhelmed, I am actually excited--I AM EXCITED ABOUT MATH?!? Wow, I could never have believed that in a million years. You have help me get a shot at a scholarship when I had no idea how I would even attempt to compete, but I never gave up on the dream and here I am. Better yet, you gave me something back. You gave me hope not only for my future, but you gave me hope that someone out there cares, and make a difference.  
    
    People say the future of education lies in the Internet. I say it begins with your website, with your videos. It begins with Khan Academy. Once I achieve my goals, once I realized my dreams, Khan Academy will be the first thing I think about, when I repay all those who help me along the way.
    
    I promise and I thank you.
