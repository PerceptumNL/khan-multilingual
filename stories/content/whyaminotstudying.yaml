    I haven't done any math for about 17 years, yet in the past few months, you have taught me enough to give me so much of what I desperately needed in order to achieve my dreams. I've never met you, yet you have done so much for me

    It's funny, because I'm 32, I was a big fan of math and science when I was young, but at about 15 I fell in love with music so much that I pretty much dropped out of everything else. I stopped caring about any grades in school and focused on getting into a high-level music conservatory. I got into Manhattan School of Music, played with some of the best musicians in the world, had a great budding career, but time, life, family, and opportunity never quite got to a point where I could feel close to being able to support a family comfortably. A classical musician, after all, has to live in an expensive city to find work.

    I am back in school studying for Engineering. I am actually starting on January 9th, but I have to take another placement exam on January 3rd, because I've placed too high on the school's standard exam and if I do well enough, I could knock 3 more courses (to the tune of 3 semesters) off of my goal.

    I've been unemployed more often than not in the past 4 years and I decided that I was going to change my life drastically. I know the tools can be found in other places to get what I want accomplished, but your work is so helpful in filling my head with the right things at the right stages.

    I haven't done any math for about 17 years, yet in the past few months, you have taught me enough to give me so much of what I desperately needed in order to achieve my dreams. I've never met you, yet you have done so much for me.

    Why am I not studying? Because I wanted to take a moment to thank my teacher.
