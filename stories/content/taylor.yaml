    As a student myself who has a learning disability when it comes to math and physics, I have to say that Sal Khan has literally changed my life and the outcome of my grades. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and making it freely accessible to students like me who want to do better in school. I now have faith that there are people out there who truly can make learning simple and understandable for everyone.
