    As a primary (Australian for elementary) school student, I felt like maths came fairly natural to me. As I got into high school, my family moved around and maths became much more difficult, I missed chunks of the fundamentals here and there and having bad/impatient teachers, made me afraid of maths.

    I have now graduated with my business degree, but found my job unchallenging and boring. I realised that if I wanted a more challenging and meaningful career, I would have to take more maths subjects. So I signed up to take pre-cal and calculus, and discovered Khan Academy and it has changed my life. I worked hard with the help of Khan Academy and have realised, like many others that mathematics is beautiful and not that scary after all. I log onto Khan Academy everyday and do maths problems for fun.

    I am now about to embark on a journey I never thought I would be on: I am going back to University to do a degree in Advanced Maths. I am inspired by all the other stories here, and hope that mine will inspire others as well.  Seriously, if I can do it, ANYONE CAN!
