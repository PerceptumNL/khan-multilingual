    I am the parent of a high functioning autistic child. The available services at my sons school could not reach him. He cannot learn in a large group setting but the small group learning available was way below his skill level. This left him feeling stupid and discouraged. It makes me wonder how many kids are like him. With Khan Academy his math skills are blossoming but more importantly, his confidence in his academic abilities is growing by leaps and bounds

    I am the parent of a high functioning autistic child. The available services at my sons school could not reach him. He cannot learn in a large group setting but the small group learning available was way below his skill level. This left him feeling stupid and discouraged. It makes me wonder how many kids are like him. With Khan Academy his math skills are blossoming but more importantly, his confidence in his academic abilities is growing by leaps and bounds. My mom, a retired Junior High Math teacher, is beyond impressed with Khan Academy. Our Question- Why aren't more schools adopting this?
