    Maths hated me. It has hated me since the start of Year 1 ( 1st Grade). The teachers always give me frowns and dirty looks which is pretty embarresing for some people. The papers that has been handed in are just filled in with boring equations. At home, I was always forced to study Maths. I only had to study Maths so I can actually make a living. But I wasn't worrying about that, I was worrying about my lack of knowledge. I always played video games which is completely off-topic if you're referring it to Mathematics. I went on the computer and typed in ''Best Educational Websites'' and it came out KHAN ACADEMY. I gave a click, and made an account, and then after a few days my brain was filled with knowledge, that inspired me to like Maths. I kept on going on this site for weeks, and I had the best score for my tests, and I am in the top set so far...and I owe it all to you, Khan and the Khan Academy itself. You guys are true heroes. The legendary Mathematics Website,  I would obviously recommend it  5 star-rated.
