    ...Math has not been my friend. Ever. Then I met Khan Academy and I felt as if a veil was lifted from my eyes. I haven't taken a math course in almost 10 years, the last being Algebra I, and currently I am three weeks away from an A in an online Algebra II class at my city college. I've already enrolled in geometry for the summer session and trig for the fall and have plans at completing or exceeding calculus. A college degree was only wishful thinking in the past but now I'm seriously looking at medical school, chemical engineering, or computer programming. Khan gave me the confidence (along with friends and family) to return to school and perhaps it's my adult mind but things make sense!

    This is not a unique story in any way shape or form, and it is still a work in progress I feel morally obligated to share my successes to date with you and the world. I could go into detail about my background... (crying over multiplication tables in 6th grade... seriously) but I rather keep this short and to the point. Math has not been my friend. Ever. Then I met Khan Academy and I felt as if a veil was lifted from my eyes. I haven't taken a math course in almost 10 years, the last being Algebra I, and currently I am three weeks away from an A in an online Algebra II class at my city college. I've already enrolled in geometry for the summer session and trig for the fall and have plans at completing or exceeding calculus. A college degree was only wishful thinking in the past but now I'm seriously looking at medical school, chemical engineering, or computer programming. Khan gave me the confidence (along with friends and family) to return to school and perhaps it's my adult mind but things make sense! Everything makes sense in fact and life couldn't be better. So many more videos and so little time. I hope we see an iPhone app in the future and thank you thank you thank you! Your humor, your knowledge, your dedication. Maybe I could have done it without Khan but this is the Ace up my sleeve. Here's to free accessible knowledge!
