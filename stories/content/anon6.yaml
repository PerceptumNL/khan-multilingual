    I was always a good student, never the very best, but usually near the top of my class. Most of my friends and acquaintances tend to label me as "smart" (even if I am socially inept), however in my junior year of high school I fell apart. I would sit in my classes, while a teacher explains and it would all pass over me. It was horrible, it's as if, out of the blue, the learning center in my brain decided to shut down. I totally lost confidence in my ability to learn or achieve at anything. I went through junior year barely passing several classes and only doing decently at English and history. I descended into a deep depression in which some days all I would do is sit and stare at the ceiling once I came home from school. I would sometimes lash out violently at my friends and very often at my parents over any bit of criticism. There were numerous occasions in my household in which my mother threatened to call the police. I started believing teachers WANTED me to flunk out and that my own parents really just wanted me out of their way. On several occasions I promised them to commit suicide so I wouldn't be such a hopeless waste of space. I figured I was useless. What gave me the worst feeling was seeing so many of my friends and peers excel at school even though many of them didn't even appear all that invested in their school work. It led me to believe that I was just dumb. How could I be exerting all this energy only to fall flat?
    
    Sometime in April 2011 I really started digging in and working hard to salvage what was left from my year. I was tired of wasting time and tired of being full of self pity. I was lucky enough to never succumb to substance abuse and there was literally NO REASON IN THE WORLD FOR ME TO FEEL LIKE THIS. I had never faced anything more than the average trials and tribulations of a white working class kid with loving parents and let's face it, I had turned into a spoiled slacker who needed to get his act together. I started out by simply cramming through as much calculus on my own as I could during my April vacation (Despite my poor performance in class, calculus and physics always intrigued me). A close friend of mine eventually linked me to an MIT opencourseware video and I was immediately hooked. From there I went on to discover Khan Academy. In the summer between junior an senior year, most of my time was spent on Khan Academy, MIT Opencourseware, and I had been audacious enough to enroll in a biochemistry class at Harvard University's summer school. Although Khan Academy was not my only influence at the time, it was an integral part of my daily life. Everything I did revolved around watching Khan Academy videos and doing Khan Academy exercises in order to keep progressing and fill gaps in my knowledge. I think I've reached a point in which there's really no topic that I feel is "too difficult." As a senior I'm currently taking the most difficult course load possible at my high school, and doing marvelously at it. There is so much I don't know and so much that is endlessly fascinating! Despite everything I've somehow managed to position myself into graduating comfortably within the top 10 percent of my class (amazing what one year can do). I intend to continue my studies as a physics major in college and who knows where that will take me!
