    I bombed my math placement test when I was enrolling at UW-Milwaukee.  Thanks to Khan Academy, I spent a few weeks relearning all the algebra and trig things I forgot about, and learned some new ones. I did well enough on my retake that I tested out of two classes, saving myself well over $2000 in tuition! Not to mention I instantly moved that much closer to my degree!  Keep up the AWESOME work, Sal and team!
