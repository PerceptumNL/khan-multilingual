    I was educated in Parochial (church) schools that, at the time, in the 60's and 70's allowed corporeal punishment.  To say the least I hated school.  I received a fairly good basic education but never really enjoyed or excelled in anything, especially math. Now I am working my way through your math videos.  I love this site.  Thank you Khan Academy.
