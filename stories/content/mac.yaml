  Once described as the "most disabled child to ever be mainstreamed" Mac 8yo is now working at, or above, grade level (particularly in maths).  Khan Academy was the perfect fix for a, then 6yo, "maths nut" with cerebral palsy who was too physically tired to do homework at the end of each day.  The colours on the black background are perfect for his vision impairment.  Mac now thinks he might like to be a maths teacher at university... or the Khan Academy. Mac's about to start using the online options with his foot switches, morse code typing and assistive computer technology.  Thanks for levelling the playing field...
