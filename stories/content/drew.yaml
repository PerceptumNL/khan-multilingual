    ...This site has been very dear to me for the past month. I'm a 38-year-old who's never gone to college...I started off with Khan Academy math lessons at the beginning, 1 + 1 = 2, in the arithmetic section and over the last few weeks studied my way back toward college Algebra. Along the way I've strengthened weaknesses and filled in gaps and discovered many of the reasons why I was greatly challenged by math in the past, even though I had great love for many of the concepts. Next week I should be ready for the test and feel about the best prepared for anything I've ever done

    This site has been very dear to me for the past month. I'm a 38-year-old who's never gone to college. I've been an audio engineer for almost 20 years now and I can design and mix sound for movies or help a band make an album or record pretty much anything for use in pretty much any context. But career-wise I wasn't really headed anywhere interesting or profitable so it seemed like the right time to finally go to college.
    
    I'm studying for a math placement test, brushing up on what I know, kicking the rust off of what I've forgotten. I've spent about 3 hours every day for about a month working on my math skills because I'll be an Electrical Engineering student. A worthy field to study I figure, since I've always wanted to know how amplifiers and compressors and mixers and microphones and speakers are made. I'll learn how to make my own.
    
    I started off with Khan Academy math lessons at the beginning, 1 + 1 = 2, in the arithmetic section and over the last few weeks studied my way back toward college Algebra. Along the way I've strengthened weaknesses and filled in gaps and discovered many of the reasons why I was greatly challenged by math in the past, even though I had great love for many of the concepts. Next week I should be ready for the test and feel about the best prepared for anything I've ever done.
    
    I expect to continue spending a great deal of time here at khanacademy.org throughout the next four years and onward. Learning at my own pace is the best for my retention pattern but slowing down or repeating lessons or dragging a subject on for hours just isn't possible in a classroom. (There are, however, other people in the classroom who influence and react and help and there's immeasurable value in that.)
    
    Making education accessible to as many people as possible is one of the noblest things in the world and I have great admiration for the makers of Khan Academy. I think textbooks won't be obsolete until more people have computer access in the world but realizing the potential of lessons of this quality reaching anyone with a web browser truly inspires awe. I sent an email to the developers remarking on the latest changes to the streak bar and they encouraged me to share it here, so here it is - 
    
    Subject - Streak bar feedback    
    
    At first, I missed the streak bar. I loved the ratio it gave me right after the first question is answered. It was like, wow! Look how much progress I've made already! and then how it progressed less and less as the exercise went on, it really heightened the challenge. But now that the streak bar isn't within the exercise I realize that heightening the challenge really isn't the goal here. The goal is about learning something and measuring your progress. And now that the streak bar seems to have moved outside the exercise, to appear just afterward, there's still a feeling of relief and accomplishment as the bar shoots up but I also have a way better sense of where I am in a bigger picture. Working on polynomials and quadratics has never been fun to me, and I still would hesitate to say studying math is fun, but recently math opened up like a flower and I went, whoa! This shit is sweet! When I realized ALL whole numbers are either primes or multiples of primes, it blew my mind and I realized there are even better things than fun out there. Feeling like you have the potential and now the means to learn anything and add something to the sum of human knowledge is an awesome feeling and one of the proudest moments a human being can have.
    
    Thanks for making the best thing about the internet. When somebody says, "you know what the best thing about the internet is?" I'll say "yes".
    
    Don't tell anyone I said this. I'd be so embarrassed.
