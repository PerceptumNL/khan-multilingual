    Dear Khan Academy, Today in our AP Biology class, our teacher showed us a video hosted by "60 Minutes" to inform us about your website. One word: WOW. I can't believe you dedicate all this time for us, those that cannot afford a well-rounded education. Plus, you're doing it for free! Personally, it's helped me tons. I go to a public high school, and being the largest high school in California, teachers can't dedicate much time to the quality of our education. After I found out about your program and moreso your willingness to lend a hand to those of us that need this virtual one-on-one tutoring, you convinced me of excelling. Whenever I'm not confident in a topic, whatever it may be, I come here. I make sure I master every chapter learned. Now, I'm rank 3 in my graduating class and I achieved a 4.8 GPA with your help! I wanted to let you know that your work is not in vain. You're touching our personal lives and the education of the world, you're making a difference! I know when I'm all finished with college and well into my career, I WILL give back to you, because you are a large part of making me the student that I am today. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
