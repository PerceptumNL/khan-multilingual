    Before high school, I developed a sleep disorder that made it very hard to  stay awake or fall into slumber. This resulted in many absences from school along with low grades and even some failures. I must have missed around a hundred days from school during my second and third year of high school combined.

    In the beginning, I was not doing anything for a majority of my time. . .  sleeping during school hours. . . awake during the night, thinking and  trying to go to sleep. Not only was I wasting time by not going to school,  but when I did go, I was either completely lost because I missed a few days while the class kept going, or sleep deprived. I depended on the teachers and the school to teach me what I needed to know. When I asked for help to  perhaps get home-schooled, extra tutoring, or something. . . I received nothing.

    This is what fueled my desire to teach myself everything I needed to know.  I could not count on the school to help me learn what I needed to learn in  order to progress though high school, so I did the majority of learning and teaching by myself. I asked to borrow books, found numerous free resources  on the Internet, and even made some international friends via the Internet  to talk to. I remained desperate to go to school, but my sleep disorder made it impossible for me to be consistent.

    Along the way, I discovered Khan Academy. This rendered so many of my other resources obsolete. . . I was glued to the screen. I watched that invisible pen write things while some sort of all-know deity was explaining these concepts to me so easily. . . It was as if I was meant to learn these things. . . it all fit together so nicely in the framework of my mind like  a jigsaw puzzle that did not seem to have any edges - you kept on adding pieces to it. The way you seemed to be able to explain things so effortlessly seemed magical!

    After a while, I noticed something peculiar. . . I started excelling, especially in mathematics and the sciences. As a result of teaching myself  and using your videos, I was not being rushed. I was learning at my own pace. I was understanding the material more. I was developing my knowledge  on many ideas and becoming immersed. . . I wanted to learn more. It was so  amazing that I could do so - and for free. . . and better yet, any time I wanted, even when I was awake during late hours, wanting to go to school and learn.

    As a senior in high school, I no longer have troubles getting to school.  However, I do not believe I would be as interested in the world as I am today without Khan Academy. Sal. . . you  and the rest of the team (I discovered Vi Hart and Brit Cruise too - Iâ€™m glad they are also on board!)  not only got me passed my first three years of high school, but inspired me to do so much more. There's so many lessons to learn, so many discoveries to make, so many puzzles to solve. . . but so little time. . . and nothing  will get in the way of my desire to do those things. You are helping me accomplish my goals and. . . and it would be impossible to communicate how  thankful I am for what you have done and are doing.
