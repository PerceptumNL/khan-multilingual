    As a kid I was constantly moved around by my parent mid school year as they pursued their career. I bounced from country to country and never got a chance to learn the basics. I always thought I was stupid as I struggled in school. I am a very smart person and now as I am older I realize my deficiencies are a direct result of my fragmented leanings. Now as an adult I am utilizing Khan Academy to make up for deficiencies in my education. I have an MBA and a Economics degree but still see benefit from Khan Academy. I wish this resource was there when I was younger as it would have helped me have a better foundation. I hope to make up for my lost years using Khans resources.
