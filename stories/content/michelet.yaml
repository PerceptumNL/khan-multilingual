   I have not been in school for a very long time. After high school I did a tour in the Marine Corps and ended up getting injured. I didn't want to get out, but was forced to. I went to work for a company and after 12 years I decided to finally get off my butt and get a degree. I am 36 years old with my whole career ahead of me. I want to thank the Khan Academy for helping me ace my first math class in 19 years. There is nothing like the feeling you get when you suddenly grasp a concept (or formula or whatever it is). If I don't understand something at first I will sit for hours until I get it. When I do have that "ahh ha!!" moment, there is nothing like it!  Thank you!
