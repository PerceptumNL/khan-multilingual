    I took my daughter out of school age 8 when I realised she could not add 2 + 2, and indeed was becoming terrified of maths. (we live in the UK).  I tried firstly to help her myself, but she was convinced she couldn't do it, and would not even try.  Tutors came and went, to no avail, she would just cry silent tears, and things got worse, if possible!  So I decided to just leave it for a while.  She is intelligent and great in other areas, so I was sure things would click one day. Roll forward 6 years -  a few weeks ago I was reading an article in the paper about "maths anxiety" - which was interesting, but one of the commentators of the article included a link to Khan Acadamy.  Oh My Goodness!  From the very first video - we had to go back to basic addition - I could see this was going to be different!  She loved the way that Sal explained EVERY little detail, but not in a patronising way.  For the first time in her life, she has just finished a maths session and said "I enjoyed that" - music to my ears, and such a relief.  LOVING the programme, learning stuff myself too:)  Please keep them coming, and THANK YOU:)
