   	I've always been TERRIBLE at math and unfortunately I've always had terrible and very unhelpful teachers. My dad told me about Khan academy when I was a sophomore in college and for the first time in my life I not only got an A in my statistics class but I received an A+. I used Khan academy's statistics module to study for every test and with a grade based on only 5 exams I consistently earned 95s and higher. I was also one of only a couple students that received an A, about 20% of the class dropped and others did very poorly. Khan academy teaches in a way that makes sense to me and allows me to thrive in a subject I've always struggled with. The reason I got an A+ is statistics (and my first A+ in college) was because I had Khan academy as a resource. Now, if only Khan academy could add some modules for Anatomy and physiology and microbiology, I would be solid. :)  I love Khan Academy, and one day, when I'm really rich, I'm going to donate lots of money to Khan Academy.
