    Wow. A hundred times, even a thousand or probably million, wow. I am a sixth grader in Florida who USED to hate math from the bottom of my heart. Not because I was terrible at it, but because it was boring. I had already learned all that stuff. Now, at Khan Academy, I can zoom ahead. In fact, I made the calculations that if I keep up at this pace, I'll be at calculus in a little less than a year! Thank you, Angels of Math!
