    The final moment came, when I took my next test in AP Calculus class. I was nervous at first, and had started to panic. The questions looked foreign to me. Then Sal's voice came into my head.

    Education is just not what it used to be. I really mean it when I say some of my teachers were very incompetent and weren't able to teach the material to the students in my classes. Sometimes, the material was rushed, in order to meet some deadline, such as an AP Exam or the end of a semester. Some teachers were nice, but just couldn't teach. It's hard to see a student go from one grade to the next with just barely passing the subject, and then facing problems with gaps in their education. This was a significant problem for me.

    I took Pre-Calculus, but the course hadn't included all the information I would need to continue on to AP Calculus. We skipped chapters in the textbook, and the teacher told us that the material wasn't needed. This was in the 2010-2011 school year. I am taking AP Calculus this year. In the beginning, I struggled greatly from the gaps in concepts I should have learned in my Pre-Calculus class, such as Optimization and Related Rates. I was a straight A student, and got As in Pre-Calculus. But my grades went down the toilet. I dropped to a B, then to a D. Being a straight A student all my life, I was completely devastated at my failure. I realized I had really hit rock bottom when I received a 39% on a test. I was told that if I didn't get adequate help soon, I would need to drop down to either Calculus Honors, or take Pre-Calculus again. I was beginning to hate math, a subject that had always been my favorite since as far back as I can remember. This had become a huge problem for me.

    This very low point in my life prompted me to look online for solutions. I searched and searched, looking for the solution. I finally came across a website where a student recommended going to khanacademy.org. My desperate situation caused me to follow this student's advice, and clicked the link. I was then taken to the website, and met my thousands of videos, all free of charge. I was completely ASTOUNDED by all this information just waiting for me to view. Quickly, I looked for the Calculus section, and looked up Chain Rule, another topic I was failing at. As I watched the video, clear understanding hit me that I hadn't had for months. Literally, I said to myself "Sal just explained this concept clearly in 10 minutes, and my teacher couldn't simply have said this instead of spending 2 hours on the matter?"

    The colors and the blackboard, as well as Khan's enthusiastic voice made learning math a great experience for me. I began to fill in the major gaps in my knowledge of pre-calculus and calculus. I even viewed some of the Biology videos, which have helped me tremendously in AP Biology (since my teacher literally spends the whole time talking about her kids and barely going through the required chapters).

    The final moment came, when I took my next test in AP Calculus class. I was nervous at first, and had started to panic. The questions looked foreign to me. Then Sal's voice came into my head. "All you have to do is take the integral of this, then you..." It was like Sal had guided me through the questions on the test. I got back my results a few days afterwards, and I had received a 94%! It was my first A since starting the class, and I was elated! Without Salman Khan, I might have failed AP Calculus. My hope in passing the class has been renewed. I received an A for the third quarter in my school, and I am hoping to pass the semester with an A. Thank you Salman Khan for creating Khan Academy, and for rejuvenating the hopes of millions of students around the world.
