	<p class="lead">Khan Academy is ready to go with a reliable internet connection and a modern web browser.</p>
	
	<p>Since beginning our work with schools in late 2010, we've seen schools successfully use a variety of devices and browsers. The most important things to have in place are accounts for logging in to KA, computers and devices, and internet connectivity.</p>
	
	<h3>Log-in / accounts</h3>
	<p>For a large number of accounts, we recommend Google Apps for Education (described in the <a href="/toolkit/setting-up-accounts">accounts section</a>). Google Apps for Education is the only way to register students under age 13 on Khan Academy (with appropriate parental consent).</p>
	<p>Today, for all users, we support Google and Facebook authentication; we do not have our own authentication service.</p>
	
	<h3>Computers and devices</h3>
	<p>Khan Academy runs entirely in your browser, and there is no special software required to use the site, so you can access KA with any device that runs a modern internet browser. In the schools we work with we have seen the whole gamut including laptops, Chromebooks, Netbooks, iPads, and other tablet devices.</p>
	<p>We recommend having a 1:1 student-to-computer ratio in the classroom when using KA. At many schools, classroms share laptop carts. We've also seen some schools employ an open-access policy that permits students to bring in their own devices.</p>
	
	<h3>Internet connectivity</h3>
	<p>Classrooms should have adequate access-point availability and bandwidth:</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li><strong>Access points</strong>
		For full access to the site, make sure your wireless can accommodate every student working simultaneously on Khan Academy</li>
		<li><strong>Connection speed (bandwidth)</strong>
		Khan Academy requires a broadband connection (~1.5 Mbps for a single machine viewing standard definition video) to watch videos, practice using exercises, and view data</li>
	</ul>	
	
	<h3>YouTube filtering</h3>
	<p>If you'd like your students to be able to watch Khan Academy videos and other educational content without giving them full access to YouTube, you can sign up for <a href="http://youtube.com/education_signup">YouTube for Schools</a></li>. Find full details on setting up YouTube for Schools <a href="http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1686318">here</a>.</p>
