	<h1>Welcome to the Teacher Toolkit!</h1>
	<hr>

    <p class="lead">We are constantly learning from inspiring teachers and students.</p>
		
	<p>Since late 2010, we have partnered with educators using Khan Academy in classrooms. Through these partnerships we can better understand how our tools are being used in classrooms today, equipping us to build even better tools in the future. Treat this toolkit as one view on how Khan Academy can be used in the classroom; we encourage you to continue to innovate!</p>
	<p>First, check out Sal's take on blending digital and physical learning:</p>
