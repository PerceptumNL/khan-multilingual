        <h2>A small team trying to do something big</h2>
        <p>
            We're a small team trying our best to improve the way the world learns. Too many people around the globe don’t have access to good education materials, or they are forced to learn through a system that doesn't properly cater to their individual needs. We think the technology exists today to fundamentally change this, and we're trying to build the tools and resources every student deserves.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe a few great people can make a big difference. We strive to hire the very best &mdash; people who are passionate, thoughtful and creative. We believe it is our obligation to relentlessly focus on what the learner values, and we make every decision with the learner in mind.
