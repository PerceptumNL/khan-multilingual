This is taken from
   http://code.google.com/p/asynctools
with a local change to fix
   http://code.google.com/p/asynctools/issues/detail?id=14

Other than the local change, this is the same as r33.

I could create an svn subrepo, and acutally pull the changes from
google code, but given that this code hasn't been updated since 2009,
I think just copying it into our source tree will work fine.
